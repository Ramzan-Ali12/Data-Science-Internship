Day 1:

Small Project: Dataset Exploration and Cleaning

Dataset: Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) "smartCard-inline")

datasets are attached in the attachment

Project Description: Explore the Titanic dataset, understand the variables, and identify missing values.

Project Goals: Familiarize yourself with the dataset structure, identify data cleaning requirements, and document initial observations.

Expected Output: Summary of dataset variables, identification of missing values, and initial insights.

Assignment: Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on a given dataset.

Step 1: Remove duplicates from the dataset.

Step 2: Handle missing values by imputing or removing them.

Step 3: Check and handle outliers in the data.

Step 4: Normalize or standardize numerical features.

Step 5: Encode categorical variables.
Interview questions and answers:

Q1: What is data cleaning, and why is it important?A1: Data cleaning refers to the process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset. It is important because it ensures the quality and reliability of the data used for analysis.

Q2: What are some common data cleaning techniques?A2: Some common data cleaning techniques include handling missing values, removing duplicates, dealing with outliers, correcting inconsistent data, and standardizing data formats.

Q3: How do you handle missing values in a dataset?A3: Missing values can be handled by imputing them with mean, median, or mode values, using predictive models, or removing the rows or columns with missing values depending on the context.

Q4: What is the purpose of outlier detection, and how can it be performed?A4: Outlier detection helps identify unusual or extreme observations in a dataset. It can be performed using statistical methods like the z-score, IQR (interquartile range), or visualization techniques like box plots or scatter plots.

Q5: Explain the concept of feature scaling.A5: Feature scaling is the process of standardizing or normalizing numerical features to a common scale to ensure they have a similar impact on the analysis or modeling algorithms.



Basic definitions and terms:- Missing values: Values that are absent or unavailable in a dataset.- Outlier detection: The process of identifying extreme or unusual observations in a dataset.- Feature scaling: Rescaling numerical features to a common scale.- Data cleaning: The process of identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in a dataset.- Preprocessing: The steps taken to transform raw data into a suitable format for analysis or modeling.
