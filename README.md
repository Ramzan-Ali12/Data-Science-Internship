## TASK 1

Minor Project: Dataset Exploration and Cleaning

Dataset: Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster - Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) "smartCard-inline")
datasets are attached in the attachment
Project Description: Explore the Titanic dataset, understand the variables, and identify missing values.f with the dataset structure, identify data cleaning requirements, and document initial observations.
Expected Output: Summary of dataset variables, identification of missing values, and initial insights.
Assignment: Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on a given dataset.
Step 1: Remove duplicates from the dataset.
Step 2: Handle missing values by imputing or removing them.
Step 3: Check and handle outliers in the data.
Step 4: Normalize or standardize numerical features.
Step 5: Encode categorical variables.

# Day 2:

## TASK 1

Minor Project: Build a linear regression model based on a given dataset to predict housing prices.
Step 1: Load and explore the dataset, including visualizing the features and target variable.
Step 2: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Step 3: Preprocess the data by handling missing values and performing feature scaling.
Step 4: Train a linear regression model on the training data.
Step 5: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared.
